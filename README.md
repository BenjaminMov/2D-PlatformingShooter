## Local multiplayer PvP 2d platforming shooter

**What does this application do?**
The purpose of this project is to produce a two player 2d shooter. Each player will have the ability to reload (increase ammunition), shoot a pellet, and create a temporary shield which reflects incoming pellets. Along with this, implementation of various power-ups and abilities are being considered:
- Snake gun that allows the user to control the pellet that they shoot like the classic arcade game 'snake'
- Faster reload
- Range increase of pellets fired

**Who will use it?**
The program is designed for local multiplayer, where two people are able to play without internet, and enjoy a high-intensity quick match of skill.
**Why is this project of interest?**
With the evergrowing existance of online multiplayer battle royales and single-player open world games, the market for local co-op/PvP games has dwindled. My favourite games have always been local multiplayer games:
- Super Smash Bros.
- Mario Party
- Nidhogg
- Duck game
- Fifa

Because of my passion and liking of such games, I feel it is a good challenge and test of my programming ability to see if I can make a game of such a standard for me and my friends to honestly enjoy.
